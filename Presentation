INTRODUCTION
	In Athens, Greece there are many restaurants, especially offering local delicacies as well as international cuisine. 
	John Doe, having lived in the area for more than 20 years, has the sense that a Vegan Restaurant is what is missing; 
	there is also an increasing trend for vegan food in the city, therefore he thinks this could be a real success.
	He has already found the recipes and the personnel, however he is not sure about the location.
