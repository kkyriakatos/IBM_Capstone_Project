DATA SOURCES FOR THE PROJECT
	
	In our research for assisting John Doe with his search for the optimal spot to establish his Vegan Restaurant, 
	we will have to retrieve data from publicly available data sources, such as Wikipedia, Open Street Map APIs, Foursquare.
	
	More specifically we will have to retrieve:
	
	
	- Information about the municipalities and communities in Athens from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens_Prefecture
	
	- The coordinates (latitude, longitude) ot these municipalities in Athens from Open Street Map APIs
	
	- From Foursquare we will need following venues data:
	  - the vegan restaurants venues of the municipalities
	  - information about the restaurant types in Athens
	  - the offices venues of the municipalities
	  - malls, business centers of the municipalities
	  - the universityâ€™s campus venues of the municipalities
	
	We will then leverage the data in order to determine which spot is the most suitable in order to build a Vegan Restaurant.
